## ðŸ“ƒ Challenges <a name="challenges"></a>

> My first challenge starts with a cors error and that was also the most common error when integrating server and client applications. It was resolved by installing rack-cors and exposing origins in rails app.

> My thinking process regarding this task is pretty straight forward. I've never tried Apollo client so I test it first to get a sample query. I defined the types for the data that are required for the display. Then I just mapped through the sections data both for the sidebar and the main component.

> When I got a overall layout, I tried to build a modal with motion library and play with some CSS to look like the UI referenced. Then I go for the details, typography, behaviour and finally the interactive sidebar.

> I noticed some new entities in the part(2) of the assignment, such as availability status and a different view for it. I added a new attribute to both section and item model in the rails server application and work along with it.

> To make sure all the sections and items are displayed in order, I also sorted the data return from api to be in ascending order. The data is sorted in that way by default but just in case anything goes wrong, we can know that it was already sorted from the server.

> Vite is not my go-to tech stack. I always use Next.js so even though I'm familiar wtih deploying React applications, I had to tweak some vite config for the deployed app to work properly on Vercel.
